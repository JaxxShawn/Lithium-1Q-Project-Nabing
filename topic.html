                    <h2> Understanding Sexual Orientation</h2>
                    <p>Sexual orientation is the enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction that a person feels toward others, along with the identity they build around those attractions. It is broader than behavior and includes deep feelings of love, affection, and connection. People may identify in many ways, such as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, or other terms that reflect the diversity of human experience. Orientation is not a choice, research suggests it develops mainly from biological factors that begin before birth, while social and cultural influences shape how individuals recognize, understand, and express it in their lives.(Planned Parenthood, n.d.).</p>

                    <h2>What Causes Sexual Orientation?</h2>
                    <p>Sexual orientation is thought to develop mainly from biological factors before birth, environmental and social influences play a role in how people come to understand, accept, and express their orientation. For instance, culture, religion, family values, peer groups, and media can affect the timing of self-recognition, the language used to describe orientation, and how safe someone feels being open about who they are. These factors shape the lived experience of sexuality, even if they do not determine the orientation itself.(Planned Parenthood, n.d.).</p>

                    <h2>Why does it even matter?</h2>
                    <p>Understanding what sexuality is matters because it supports self-awareness and helps people navigate their identity with more clarity and acceptance. Recognizing oneâ€™s sexual orientation or questioning it is a normal, deeply personal process that benefits from education, empathy, and supportive environments. When people understand their attractions and identity, they can find healthier ways to express themselves, reduce shame or confusion, and build more authentic relationships with others. It also helps foster societal respect for diversity and cultivates inclusive communities. (Therapy Group DC, 2025)</p>
